This project is inspired by the Principles of Pharmacology (PoP) course at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). 
The aim is to develop models for pharmacokinetic curve fitting by applying basic algorithms. 
These models will address the limitation of simple Excel-calculated methods which are used in class.
