This project is inspired by the Principles of Pharmacology (PoP) course at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). 
The aim is to build a model to fit pharmacokinetic data by applying gradient descent algorithm. 
This model enhances the precision of 1-compartment and 2-compartment intravenous calculation compared to simple Excel-calculated methods which are used in class.
